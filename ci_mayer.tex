\begin{abstract}
\sciwms{} is used as an extensible visualization tool for qualitativly
assessing society-critical oceanagraphic applications including:
forecasts, risk assessment, model comparison and algorithmic/parameter
selection. This abstract outlines the implementation and technology
stack for visualizing geospatial coastal forecasting (CF) data using
sci-wms~\cite{wms14}.\footnote{https://github.com/asascience-open/sci-wms}
Specifically, discussing the use case for deploying \sciwms{} for visualizing
model data and simulations within the scope of the U.S. \ioos{} Coastal
and Ocean Modeling Testbed project.~\cite{luettich13}
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}
The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (\ioos{}) Coastal and Ocean
Modeling Testbed (\comt{}) was formed to unify otherwise disparate
entities in government, academia and industry to leverage ubiquity of
computing hardware and the proliferation of coastal data and modeling
techniques to combat natural and man-made stressors by accelerating
the turnaround from research and development to operational
application of society-critical applications including forecasting,
model comparison, model skill assessment, and
algorithmic/parameterization improvements~\cite{luettich13}. Key to
the U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} mission is an extensible and universally
available tool for quickly visualizing and assessing coastal modeling data.

\section{\sciwms{}}
\Sciwms{} was designed is an implementation of the Open Geospatial
Consortium's (\ogc{}) Web Map Service (\wms{}) standard, that
describes an http interface for generating rasterized visualizations
of geospatial data~\cite{wms14}. Sci-wms is implemented in python
using the Django\footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}} web
frame work and standard cross-platform numerical software, NumPy and
Matplotlib~\cite{numpy11, hunter07} for generating visual
content. Vital to the real-time performance of sci-wms is the
abstraction of a oceanagraphic dataset into two entities: a topology,
defined as a geo-referenced spatial structure and model data as
visualized in figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}. \Sciwms{}
creates a local topology cache for efficient computing of spatial
neighborhoods with respect to topology structures.  For storage
efficiency, model data is not replicated when hosted externally, but
reference via web-enabled endpoints and subsequently retrieves only
the fraction of data needed to fulfill a \wms{} request. Queries for
data required for generating visualizations can be constrained by
requesting only subsets of data according to the portion of the earth
that is visible for a given geospatial \wms{} http request.  Furthermore, by
classifying topologies as either regular or unstructured, efficient
algorithms and data structures are utilized to optimize the response
time for each request.

    cataloged by the NGDC. Model data is hosted on an external web
    server through an NCML facade accessible to \sciwms{} through
    \opendap{} as a single \netcdf data structure. \Sciwms then
    responds to http requests made simultaneously by multiple clients
    interfacing through a custom built web-portal.}

\section{Deploying \sciwms{} for the U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} Testbed}
While \sciwms{} is a general software solution for geospatial
visualization, it is a key component in realizing the U.S. \ioos{}
\comt{} mission, facilitating qualitative model comparisons and
aggregation through a unified visualization
framework. Figure~\ref{fig:overview1} outlines the cyberinfrastructre
behind the deployment of \sciwms{} for the \comt{} project.

Raw coastal data is hosted by the Southeastern Universities Research
Association (\sura{}) on a dedicated server for \comt{}
project~\cite{luettich12}. Each data set may consist of multiple files
in different formats, and may be the results of very different models
run by various institutions with disparate computing
resources. However, accompanying each dataset is an \ncml{} virtual
layer which exposes each dataset as a single \netcdf{}
object. Furthermore, the \ncml facade presents a consistent set of meta
information in accordance to CF-Conventions~\cite{cf} so
that services like \sciwms{} can access the data through a uniform
interface.

Once an \ncml{} file is confirmed to be CF-Compliant, the dataset is
indexed by \noaa{}\footnote{National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration} \ngdc{}\footnote{National Geophysical Data Center}
an is made accessible via an \ogc{} catalogue web service (\csw{}). A
nightly executable queries the \ngdc{} catalogue for new or modified
datasets and automatically updates both the topologies and \opendap{}
links in registered in the \sciwms{} database. At any time \sciwms{} is able to
respond to queries for visualizations of any registered dataset by
multiple users simultaneously.
