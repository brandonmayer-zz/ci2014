\section{\sciwms{} Deployment: U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} Testbed Project}
\label{sec:ioos}
The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (\ioos{}) Coastal and Ocean
Modeling Testbed (\comt{}) was formed to unify otherwise disparate
entities in government, academia and industry to leverage the
proliferation of oceanographic data and modeling techniques to combat
natural and man-made coastal stressors by accelerating the turnaround
from research and development to operational application of
society-critical applications including: forecasting, model
comparison, model skill assessment, and algorithmic/parameterization
improvements~\cite{luettich13}. A crucial component for the success of
the U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} mission is a web accessable tool for quickly
visualizing and assessing a diverse set of coastal modeling and
observational data. While \sciwms{} is a general software solution for
geospatial visualization, it is a key component in realizing the
U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} mission, facilitating qualitative model
comparisons and aggregation of distributed data with a unified
visualization framework.

Figure~\ref{fig:overview1} outlines the cyberinfrastructre behind the
deployment of \sciwms{} for the \comt{}
project\footnote{\url{http://testbedwww.sura.org/explorer/}}. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\noaa{}) - National
Geophysical Data Center (\ngdc{}) geoportal indexes public geophysical
datasets and provides an \ogc{} \csw{} service to query datasets by
their metadata attributes. \sciwms{} queries the \ngdc{} Geoportal at
regular intervals updating the local topology cache and
structure-endpoint database
(figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}) with new or modified
datasets. Raw coastal data is hosted by the Southeastern Universities
Research Association (\sura{}) on a dedicated server for the \comt{}
project~\cite{luettich12}. Each data set may consist of multiple files
in different formats, and may be the result of very different models
run by various institutions with disparate computing
resources. However, accompanying the raw data is an \ncml{} virtual
layer which exposes each dataset as a single \netcdf{}~\cite{netcdf},
\opendap{}~\cite{Cornillon03} accessible object. Furthermore, the
\ncml{} facade presents a consistent set of meta information in
accordance to CF-Conventions~\cite{cf} providing services like
\sciwms{} access to the raw data through a uniform interface.

Currently, \Sciwms{} is used to visualize data from the first phase
groups of \ioos{} \comt{} program: {\em estuarine hypoxia, shelf
  hypoxia and coastal inundation}~\cite{luettich13}. For each modeling
group, \sciwms{} successfully generates consistent visualizations of
data generated by \adcirc{}~\cite{adcirc}, \fvcom{}~\cite{chen06},
\selfe{}~\cite{zhang08} and \slosh{}~\cite{chen84} coastal modeling
algorithms and serves as a use-case for how \sciwms{} can be leveraged
as a scalable solution for delivering visualizations of
scientific data to a diverse community.

\sciwms{} currently supports contour and filled-contour visualizations
styles for scalar attributes while 2D flow fields can be shown as
arrows or barbs for vector valued
attributes. Figure~\ref{fig:adcirc_comp} shows a web portal utilizing
the \sciwms{} backend to compare ADCIRC model output for Hurricane Ike
with water levels observed by \noaa{} stations and
figure~\ref{fig:vims_selfe_chesapeake} visualizes current direction
and speed in the Chesapeake Bay area. Figure~\ref{fig:vims_selfe_ssh}
renders the sea surface wave height computed along the Atlantic coast
of South America, the Gulf of Mexico, up to Canada. The topology in
this example is unstructured (\ugrid{}), a triangulation containing
over 5 million vertices (sample locations). Attributes are fetched
from the appropriate external server as needed, rendered, cached for
performance, but ultimately discarded after processing to minimize
storage redundency. Ongoing development is in progress for \sciwms{}
to support emerging geophysical datasets such as ensemble model output
and to provide clear visual support for the assessment and
quantification of model skill and performance metrics.
