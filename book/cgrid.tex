\subsection{\cgrid{} Topology}
A \cgrid{} (also known as {\bf regular} or {\bf structured}) topology
refer to structures that can be defined analytically, e.g.,
rectilinear or curvilinear grids. Storing a \cgrid{} topology amounts
to storing the closed-form expression. Algorithms for processing
\cgrid{}s such as finding nearest neighbors or computing points that
fall withing a polygonal subset are computed directly using the
implicit \cgrid{} representation, incurring minimal computational
overhead.
