\subsection{\cgrid{} Topology}
\cgrid{} topologies refer geo-referenced locations with connectivity
relations that can be defined analytically, e.g., rectilinear or
curvilinear grids. Storing \cgrid{} topologies amount to storing the
closed-form expression. Algorithms for processing \cgrid{}s such as
finding nearest neighbors or computing points that fall withing a
polygonal subset are computed directly using the implicit \cgrid{}
representation, incurring minimal computational overhead.
