\Sciwms{}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/brandonmayer/sci-wms}} is an open-source Web Map Service (\wms{})~\cite{wms14}
written in Python using the Django~\cite{django} web framework and
standard cross-platform numerical software, NumPy~\cite{numpy11} and
Matplotlib~\cite{hunter07} for generating visual content. The \wms{}
specification defines a Representational State Transfer (REST)
API~\cite{Fielding02} which responds to standardized HTTP GET requests
from a \wms{} client for serving rasterized visualizations of
geospatial data. A typical \wms{} request specifies a data layer and
region of interest with optional meta data such as rendering style
parameters. A \wms{} response may include additional information
regarding datasets registered with the service or a visualization in
the form of a PNG or other standard image format. A base \wms{} client
has been developed in \javascript{}, which gives analysts the ability
to generate and interact with visualizations using nothing but a
standard web browser~\cite{comtui}.  The \wms{} client is likewise
open-source, was used to create the visualizations in
section~\ref{sec:ioos}, and is currently in active use for
U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} project outlined in section~\ref{sec:ioos}.

External datasets to be visualized by \sciwms{} should be exposed by
data producers in one of the many community standard formats for
geoscientific gridded data such as \netcdf{}, \hdf{}/\hdf5,
\grib{}/\grib2 with accompanying metadata adhering to the CF (Climate
and Forecast) metadata conventions~\cite{cf}. 

While the \ogc{} \wms{} specification standardizes the client-server
communication protocol, implementations vary dramatically in how a
particular system fulfills the \wms{} request and responses. Vital to
the efficiency of \sciwms{} is the decomposition of a registered
dataset into \textbf{structure} (also known as \textbf{topology}) and
\textbf{attributes} as shown in figure~\ref{fig:data_hierarchy} and
detailed in subsequent sections. \Sciwms{} maintains a local topology
cache for efficient storage and processing of spatial neighborhoods
and subsets with respect to data structure. To minimize redundancy,
attributes are not replicated locally but referenced via standard
web-services and a database of structure-endpoint pairs is maintained
as visualized in figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}. As
geospatial \wms{} requests are commonly restricted to a subset of the
Earth's surface, \sciwms{} uses the topology cache to compute the
subset of numerical attributes needed to fulfill each request prior to
retrieving the appropriate data, typically via HTTP request. Furthermore, by
classifying a topology as regular or irregular, efficient algorithms
and data structures are exploited to optimize the computation of
attribute subsets.
