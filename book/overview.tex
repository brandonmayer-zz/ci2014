\Sciwms{} is an open-source implementation of the Open Geospatial
Consortium's (\ogc{}) Web Map Service (\wms{}) standard which
specifies an HTTP interface for generating rasterized visualizations
of geospatial data~\cite{wms14}. More specifically, \wms{} defines a
REST API~\cite{Fielding02} which responds to standardized HTTP GET requests from a
web client. A typical \wms{} request specifies a data layer and region
of interest with optional meta data such as rendering style
parameters. A \wms{} response may include additional meta data
providing information about data registered with the service or a
visualization (commonly a PNG or other standard image format) of a
particular data layer for display by the front end web client.

%% \sciwms{} is implemented in Python using the Django~\cite{django} web
%% framework and standard cross-platform numerical software,
%% NumPy~\cite{numpy11} and Matplotlib~\cite{hunter07} for generating
%% visual content. Additionally, the open-source python implementation
%% provides a cross-platform \wms{} solution which can leverage the suite
%% of tools developed by the geospatial data analysis community, such as
%% pyugrid~\cite{pyugrid}, to maintain pace with the latest geospatial
%% software and standards developments including unstructured grid
%% support and \cfugrid{} Compliance~\cite{cfugrid}.

While the \ogc{} \wms{} specification standardizes the client-server
communication protocol, \wms{} implementations vary dramatically in
how a particular system fulfills the \wms{} requests and
responses. Vital to the efficiency of \sciwms{} is the abstraction of
a registered dataset into structure (also known as topology) and
attributes as shown in figure~\ref{fig:data_hierarchy} and detailed in
subsequent sections. \Sciwms{} maintains a local topology cache for
efficient storage and processing of spatial neighborhoods and subsets
with respect to data structure. For storage efficiency, attributes are
not replicated locally but referenced via OGC compliant web-services
and a database of structure-endpoint pairs is maintained as visualized
in figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}. As geospatial
\wms{} requests are commonly restricted to a subset of the Earth's
surface, \sciwms{} uses the topology cache to compute the subset of
numerical attributes needed to fulfill each request prior to
retrieving the appropriate data, which are typically external to
the server hosting \sciwms{} and accessed via HTTP. Furthermore, by
classifying a topology as regular or irregular, efficient algorithms
and data structures are exploited to optimize the computation of
attribute subsets.
