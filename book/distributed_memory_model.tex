\subsection{Distributed Memory Model}

Following these conventions, \sciwms{} decomposes an externally hosted
dataset into a structure (topology), defined as a geo-referenced
spatial set of locations and connections, and the underlying data
attribute layer.

For example, atmospheric and oceanagrphic models typically define a
fixed topology covering a particular spatial extent of the earth. A
model will extimate attributes of interest such as sea-surface-height,
wind or current magnitudes and directions. The topology of the model
encapsulates the positions and connectivity of the dataset for which
attributes are associated. Visualizations of datasets are typically
restricted so some region of interest, a subset of the available
topology and a single attribute such as current direction. It is
therefore paramount to the efficiency of visualization software to
represent topologies in such a way as to optimize topology storage and
reduction algorithms to facilitate efficient attribute retrieval.

To this end, when an dataset endpoint is submitted to \sciwms{}, the
topology of the underlying endpoint is stored locally to \sciwms{} and
a database of topology-endpoint associations are maintained as
visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}.
