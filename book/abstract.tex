\abstract*{\sciwms{}~\cite{sciwms} is an open-source web service for
  the visualization and qualitative assessment of distributed
  geospatial data. The modular cross-platform \python{} implementation
  of \sciwms{} allows the service to keep pace with the rapid
  developments in the geospatial data science community to produce
  visualizations for numerous types of model outputs with transparent
  support for both structured and unstructured geo-referenced
  topologies. This article outlines the implementation and technology
  stack for visualizing geospatial data using \sciwms{} and details
  the deployment of \sciwms{} for visualizing model data and
  simulations within the scope of the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing
  System (\ioos{}) Coastal and Ocean Modeling Testbed (\comt{})
  project~\cite{luettich13}.}
