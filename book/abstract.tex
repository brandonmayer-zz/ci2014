\abstract*{\sciwms{}~\cite{sciwms} is an open-source \python{}
  implementation of an \ogc{} \wms{} service~\cite{wms14} for
  qualitatively assessing society-critical atmospheric and
  oceanagraphic applications including forecasting, risk assessment,
  model comparison and algorithmic/parameter selection. The modular
  cross-platform implementation of \sciwms{} allows the service to
  keep pace with the rapid developments in the geospatial data science
  community and to produce visualizations for numerous types of model
  outputs with transparent support for both structured and
  unstructured geo-referenced topologies. This article outlines the
  implementation and technology stack for visualizing geospatial
  Climatological and Forecasting (CF) data using \sciwms{} and details
  the deployment of \sciwms{} for visualizing model data and
  simulations within the scope of the U.S. \ioos{} Coastal and Ocean
  Modeling Testbed project~\cite{luettich13}.}
