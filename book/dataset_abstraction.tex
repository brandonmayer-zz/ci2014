\subsection{Data Model}
Any continuous function to be represented by a digital computer must
be measured at a discrete set of samples while rendering numerical
data typically requires knowledge of the values between samples to
produce perceptually continuous images from arbitrary viewpoints. As
such, visualization tools often decompose data into structure and
attributes~\cite{vtk}.Structure encapsulates both the locations and
connectivity relations onto which attributes are superimposed and
connectivity information serves to constrain the interpolation
problem. Note that some authors continue the abstraction of structure
into topology and geometry~\cite{weiler}, however in the context of
this research, topology is synonymous with
structure. Figure~\ref{fig:data_hierarchy} outlines the data model
adopted by \sciwms{}. A dataset is composed of attributes with
associated structure which is further classified as a regular or
irregular, known as {\bf \cgrid{} } and {\bf \ugrid{}} topologies
in \sciwms{} documentation.
