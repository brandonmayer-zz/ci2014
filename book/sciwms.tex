\Sciwms{} is an open-source implementation of the Open Geospatial
Consortium's (\ogc{}) Web Map Service (\wms{}) standard which
specifies an HTTP interface for generating rasterized visualizations
of geospatial data~\cite{wms14}. \sciwms{} is implemented in Python
using the Django\footnote{\url{https://www.djangoproject.com/}} web
framework and standard cross-platform numerical software,
NumPy~\cite{numpy11} and Matplotlib~\cite{hunter07} for generating
visual content. Additionally, the open-source python implementation
provides a cross-platform \wms{} solution which can leverage the suite
of tools developed by the geospatial data analysis community such as
pyugrid\footnote{https://github.com/pyugrid/pyugrid} to maintain pace
with the latest geospatial software and standards developments such as
unstructured grid support and CF-UGrid
Compliance\footnote{https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions/blob/v0.9.0/ugrid-conventions.md}.

Vital to the efficiency of \sciwms{} is the abstraction
of a dataset into two entities: a topology, defined as
a geo-referenced spatial structure and numerical model output as
visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:sciwms_topology_endpoints}. \Sciwms{}
creates a local topology cache for efficiently computing spatial
neighborhoods with respect to topology structure.  For storage
efficiency, model output is not replicated locally but referenced via
OGC compliant web-services. Because geospatial \wms{} requests are
commonly restricted to a subset of the Earth's surface, \sciwms{} uses
the local topology to compute the subset of model data needed to
fulfill each request prior to accessing the external
data. Furthermore, by classifying topologies as either regular or
unstructured, efficient algorithms and data structures are exploited
to optimize the computation of relevant model data subsets.

    exposed by an \ncml{} facade as a single \netcdf{} data structure
    accessable to \sciwms{} via \opendap{}. \Sciwms{} responds to http
    clients interfacing through a custom built web portal.}

\section{Deploying \sciwms{} for the U.S. \ioos{} \comt{} Testbed}
While \sciwms{} is a general software solution for geospatial
visualization, it is a key component in realizing the U.S. \ioos{}
\comt{} mission, facilitating qualitative model comparisons and
aggregation through a unified visualization
framework. Figure~\ref{fig:overview1} outlines the cyberinfrastructre
behind the deployment of \sciwms{} for the \comt{} project.

The \noaa{}\footnote{National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration}--\ngdc{}\footnote{National Geophysical Data Center}
Geoportal indexes public geophysical datasets and provides an \ogc{}
Catalogue Web Service (\csw{}) to query datasets by their metadata
attributes. \sciwms{} queries the \ngdc{} Geoportal at regular intervals
updating both the topologies and \opendap{} links for all new or
modified datasets.

Raw coastal data is hosted by the Southeastern Universities Research
Association (\sura{}) on a dedicated server for the \comt{}
project~\cite{luettich12}. Each data set may consist of multiple files
in different formats, and may be the result of very different models
run by various institutions with disparate computing
resources. However, accompanying each dataset is an \ncml{} virtual
layer which exposes each dataset as a single \netcdf{} object which
may be accessed via
\opendap{}\footnote{http://www.opendap.org/}. Furthermore, the \ncml{}
facade presents a consistent set of meta information in accordance to
CF-Conventions~\cite{cf} providing services like \sciwms{} access to
the raw data through a uniform interface.

Currently, \Sciwms{} is used to visualize data from the first phase
groups of \ioos{} \comt{} program: {\em estuarine hypoxia, shelf hypoxia and
  coastal inundation}~\cite{luettich13}. For each modeling group,
\sciwms{} successfully generates visualizations from \adcirc{},
\fvcom{}, \selfe{} and \slosh{} models and serves as a use-case of how
\sciwms{} can be leveraged as a scalable solution for delivering
consistent visualizations of scientific data to a diverse community.
