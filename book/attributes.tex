\subsection{Attributes}
Attributes are defined as any numerical quantity associated with a
topology, regardless of the classification of the underlying structure
as \cgrid{} or \ugrid{}. For example, an atmospheric model may
estimate wind direction at the vertices of a triangulated 2D topology
or may compute air temperature at the centroid of cell volumes
specified by a 3D topology. Attributes have their own dimensionality
which is not correlated with the dimensionality of the topology. An
attribute specifying temperature or sea-surface-height would consist
of scalar values while wind directions are vectors, and tensor attributes
are also possible.
