\subsection{Attributes}
Attributes are defined as any numerical quantity associated with a
set of samples, regardless of the classification of the underlying
topology. For example, an atmospheric model may estimate wind
direction at the vertices of a triangulated 2D topology or may compute
air temperature at the centroid of cell volumes specified by a 3D
topology. Additionally, attributes maintain their own
dimensionallity. An attribute specifying temperature or
sea-surface-height would consist of scalar attributes
while wind directions are vector valued and tensor valued attributes
are also possible.
